    - **Dandori literally means**: step arrangement or section layout.
    - **What it does**: breaks any project (big or small) into neat, ordered steps; lines up people, tools, timing, and resources so nothing clatters or confuses you when you dive in.
    - **Where you meet it**: from the factory floor of Toyota (Lean manufacturing's secret sauce) to party‐planning, kitchen prep, school projects—or even daily to‐do lists.
    - **Why it's magical**: when you take a few moments to Dandori, you free up oodles of time later for whimsical adventures, spontaneous dance breaks, or simply a well‐earned nap. So, in short: Dandori is the cheerful practice of getting all your ducks (or dominoes!) in a row ahead of time, making life smoother—and a lot more fun—to play out.
